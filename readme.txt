A large percentage of internet users now browse the internet using smartphones or tablets; which is why it is so important that your WordPress design caters towards mobile users.
There are many case studies that illustrate how mobile usage is increasing, though it is better to see this for yourself by examining your own traffic. For example, Google Analytics shows that over the last month, 84.35% of visitors to my blog used a desktop or laptop computer, 10.91% used a mobile phone, and 4.73% used a tablet.
Mobile usage is much higher on my other websites. On Black Belt Forums, for example, Google Analytics shows that 33.10% of visitors from the last month were using a mobile phone and 11.72% used a tablet. That represents almost 45% of all traffic for the website.
Long story short, you cannot afford to give your mobile visitors a poor browsing experience. You need to give them the same attention as desktop users.
In this article, I would like to show how some useful WordPress plugins that can help you do just that.
HandHeld – (Elegant Themes Membership)

Our handheld mobile plugin delivers a responsive HTML5 design to your mobile visitors. It looks great on any smartphone operating system including iOS, Android, Windows, and Blackberry.

The plugin does not offer many configuration options. You can only choose whether statistics are recorded, whether a credit link is displayed, whether a dashboard widget is displayed, and whether the mobile theme is displayed on tablet devices.

WP Smart Mobile Theme Plugin is one of my favorite solutions for adding a mobile theme. It will display a mobile theme to people who browse your website using iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, or Windows.

The plugin retails at $18 from CodeCanyon. Once purchased, you can use the plugin on an unlimited number of websites. It is one of the only plugins that lets you create your own unique style through a user-friendly interface.

Mobile Content is a mobile detection plugin with a twist. Rather than displaying a particular theme to mobile visitors, it allows you to wrap content inside device specific shortcodes. This lets you specify certain content to desktop users, and other content for tablet users and mobile users.
The plugin also lets you display content depending on a user’s operating system or device e.g. kindle or HTC phone.
Mobile Content - Mobile Detection WordPress Plugin<a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/zen-mobile-app-native/">mobile app</a> 
Mobile Content is a flexible plugin that lets you control exactly what is displayed to your visitors.
I like many of these plugins for different reasons. I love HandHeld for its child theme support, Mobile App  Plugin for its ease of use and number of options, and WP Smart Mobile and Obox Mobile for their designs. I would also consider  if I ran a high traffic blog that could financially justify the cost of the service.

The all new WordPress Mobile Pack plugin allows webmasters to package their existing content into a mobile web application that’s compatible across different platforms. This plugin is targeted specifically at bloggers, content curators, and publishers to help them appify the content of their blog without actually creating a mobile app.

After mobile-optimizing your WordPress site with this plugin, your site will look and feel like a mobile app but in actuality, users will still be accessing it from their mobile browsers. The WordPress Mobile Pack plugin gives you the best of both worlds with this one of a kind solution.

The plugin supports all major browsers including Safari, Google Chrome, Android-native browsers, Internet Explorer 10, and Firefox. One of the best features of WordPress Mobile Pack is that it makes creating your site mobile responsive a hassle-free process. You won’t have to hire a developer or mess around with complicated code yourself.

Another amazing feature this plugin offers is that it creates a mobile-optimized web browsing experience for your site’s visitors that’s similar to an app browsing experience. This way, you won’t have to break the bank to create a designated app for your site. In addition to recognizing the device and the browser users employ to access your site, the plugin is also sensitive to the orientation of their device. Whether they have their mobile device in portrait mode or landscape mode, your site will completely morph to fit their site optimally.

The plugin’s customization options extend to its appearance. WordPress Mobile Pack ships with 6 different theme options that you can alternative between to give your site’s viewership a memorable mobile browsing experience. It also allows you to personalize the theme by changing its color palette, typography, and page elements to better fit your business’ brand.

WordPress Mobile Detector empowers webmasters to create a fully mobile responsive website version of their WordPress site without having to code a single line. It lets you mobilize your site for all of the major mobile devices including iPhone, Android, iPad, and Windows devices. The plugin works by detecting which mobile device your visitors are using to access your site and then displays a custom, the mobile compatible theme to enhance their browsing experience.

Though this plugin isn’t the most popular mobile website app out there for WordPress, it certainly has the right set of features in place to help you get started. It’s intuitive, user-friendly interface is easy to understand and navigate through. Regardless of how tech savvy you are, you won’t have any trouble setting up this plugin on your site.

The standout feature available with the WordPress Mobile Detector plugin is that it caters to both smartphones and standard mobile devices by having an optimized theme ready for both. The plugin also ships with a plethora of advanced features such as image resizing, formatting content, and mobile statistics that will skyrocket the value your site delivers.

The WordPress Mobile Detector plugin comes with a built-in theme editor that is fully interactive to the core. Webmasters and web designers can make the most of this theme editor to create a custom mobile-optimized theme for their site’s mobile responsive version or edit one of the many pre-built themes. The plugin ships with 11 mobile themes which are performance optimized to load blazingly fast and provide an efficient browsing experience. The plugin has themes for all kinds of WordPress sites – blogs, business sites, corporate sites, and even online stores.

WP Mobile Edition is an all-out mobile site plugin for WordPress that has all the right features to help you create a responsive site for your mobile visitors. According to the developers, it is a complete toolkit that comes with a mobile switcher and several different theme options right out of the box. The WP Mobile Edition plugin is fully optimized to deliver exceptional performance to your site’s viewership.

The plugin is compatible with iPhones,<a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/zen-mobile-app-native/">mobile plugin</a> Android devices, and Windows phones. It features an intuitive and easy to use interface which allows webmasters to fully customize their mobile site without having to code a single line. This saves you from having to break the bank or hire a developer to get the job done. The two main standout features are the mobile switcher functionality and the standard mobile theme.

Mobile switcher automatically detects which device your visitors have and loads either the standard desktop theme or a mobile theme, accordingly. Unlike some other plugins on our list, WP Mobile Edition isn’t incredibly flexible. Users can only select a single mobile theme to be displayed to mobile users. This essentially means that your visitors will see the same mobile page regardless of which mobile device they have. In some cases, this is much better as it works towards building brand recognition among your site’s viewership and saves you from having to design multiple mobile themes for different mobile devices.

Another useful feature on offer with the WP Mobile Edition plugin is that it allows your site’s visitors to manually switch between the desktop theme and the mobile theme if they’d like. This lightweight plugin ships with a wide-range of theme customization options right out of the box. Overall, it’s an incredible feature-rich plugin and it’s worth a shot for anyone who would like full control over their site’s mobile version.

Just like any other mobile site plugin, Mobile Smart also works by detecting which device your visitors are using to open your site from their mobile browser and displays an optimized theme if it’s a mobile device. That said, the plugin also add template tags to help you out which is a feature that’s unique to this powerful plugin.

. Plan Out Your Structure
There’s nothing more frustrating to mobile users than an overly complicated or downright nonsensical interface. [tweetable alt=”Use #flowcharts to ensure your #app structure is simple to navigate, says #SkyMark.” hashtag=””]Use flowcharts to ensure your structure is simple to navigate,[/tweetable] according to SkyMark. Also, make sure that your key functional screens, such as main menus or home pages, aren’t buried beneath less important links.

2. Use High-Resolution
With so many available mobile devices from a multitude of different providers, the variety of resolution options is endless. The easiest way to design an app with crisp imagery is to use high-resolution files — this way, your app will not only suit devices with the largest pixel ratio, but be able to scale down so that it looks great on devices with smaller ratios.

3. Keep it Simple and Uncluttered
Placing too many buttons or images on an interface will typically encourage potential customers to pass on your app. While it can be tempting to fit as much content as possible on each screen at any given moment, don’t forget that less is always more when it comes to designing for smartphones.

4. Be Original
[tweetable alt=”Originality is a priority for #apps (like @facebook #poke) but the #design process is just as crucial.” hashtag=””]Originality is an important rule in terms of an app’s concept (remember Facebook Poke, anyone?), but you should remember that the design process is just as crucial as the idea itself.[/tweetable] Take the time to add small personal touches and make your app as unique as possible.

5. Consider Your Audience
It’s important to remember that your app should be user-friendly and easy to navigate for a variety of different mobile devices and operating systems. Also, while you may find your app accessible, don’t assume everyone else will have a similar experience. Take these variables into consideration when choosing layouts or text options for your app.

6. Thoroughly Test Your App
Many of these factors can be tested by sharing your app with friends, or even by using a focus group. This will also help with seemingly basic but often forgotten parts of your app like spelling and grammar, since nothing ruins the professionalism of a design faster than poor use of language.

It’s always important to get another set of eyes to look at your app before you launch: that way, you’re less likely to overlook any key details.

Conclusions
While all these suggestions may seem overwhelming, if there’s one idea to take away from all this, it’s to keep the interface as simple as possible. That way, your big app idea can really flourish! By using interface options like app sharing, or by syncing compatibility with other smartphone utilities such as maps or calendars, you can increase the likelihood of your app’s success.

By leveraging this mobile tier detection functionality, users can allow conditional content inclusion. For instance, it’s much easier for viewers accessing your site from a tablet to view sidebars as opposed to smartphone users. So you go into the plugin’s settings and configure it so sidebars appear to visitors who use tablets. This functionality is easy to implement and requires minimal programming knowledge. All you really have to do is use the CSS selectors and you’re good to go.

Vulnerabilities in mobile applications stem not so much from malware infections as from poor security practices on the part of developers. An example of this type of lazy app development that makes mobile such a hot target for cybercriminals is the inclusion of SSL encryption libraries that are vulnerable to the Heartbleed exploit — any half-decent developer knows about these risks, unless they’ve been living under a rock for the past year.

Another instance of poor security practices from app developers is the popular app Venmo, which handles both large and small payments between its users.

Venmo’s security loopholes can’t even be called security loopholes — they’re much more like freeways down which attackers interested in taking your money can drive armored vehicles full of your stolen cash. According to Slate, linking apps like these to your bank account can be disastrous.

How Do You Secure Your Device?
Infinite Monkeys is the first mobile app provider to allow the integration of security features with anything you create — MetaCert’s Security API service can be embedded into any app made with Infinite Monkeys. The service checks external URLs for safety and warns you if they’re suspected of leading to a phishing site.

App publishers can choose what types of harmful links their app will alert users to, and those alerts can also be extended to warn about malware, gambling, and pornography sites.

CEO of MetaCert Paul Walsh stated that it was his company’s mission to “make it easy for app publishers to keep consumers and businesses safe while using their apps.”

Infinite Monkeys provides publishers with two options — which can be used simultaneously — to improve their apps’ security for their users. These include the monitoring and hardening of an app against phishing or malware attacks through third party links, as well as a link-blocking option specifically for pornography sites, which are home to many forms of online compromise.

The number of app users concerned with the safety and security of their mobile devices are growing, and so must developers’ concern for the security of their apps. Security shouldn’t come as the final step in the mobile app making process — it should be integrated into the structure of the app from the very beginning.

The plugin also features image transcoding which basically re-scales larger sized images to fit easily on devices with smaller screen sizes. Mobile Smart supports mobile traffic from iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, Windows phone, and Symbian devices. The plugin also has a pro version available with additional features.

Increase the number of loyal readers of your blog with Push Notification in your own native app for Apple and Android
Notify your blog readers with our free push notification service build into the plugin. This service will increase your number of readers largely, as they will receive notifications on their iPhone, iPad or Android smartphone whenever you have to share something with them. You can decide when and what you want to push. The notifications pops up on the Apple or Android devices and are also highlighted in the app itself. We really want to make sure that your readers will never miss a story of you again!

Secondly, there’s no access to the many premium features, even just for previewing, without at least signing-up for the 7-day trial which involves providing payment details. Yes, you can cancel but this is an unnecessary hurdle.

The problem is caused by Uppsite offering a free plan that provides an HTML5 app. The premium features apply equally to that app as they do to the mobile app making it difficult for Uppsite to make the premium features previewable on the free account but at the same time preventing them from flowing through to the HTML5 app.
